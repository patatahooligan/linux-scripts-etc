# linux-scripts-etc

This is just a repository of some scripts and configuration files I expect to
reuse across linux installations. I will slowly build it up every time I
install a new system.

Nothing here is intended to be useful to other people, but if you like anything,
feel free to download for personal use. Note that these files are primarily used
on Arch linux. Even if you use the same software, your distro might package
different, potentionally incompatible, versions.

Whenever possible, the internal structure of each directory is preserved to
allow for mass copying. For example recursively copying etc into /etc will put
every file in its appropriate place for the current Arch linux packages. Be
careful of overwriting stuff you care about when doing this.

When necessary, specific instructions for files will be added to separate readme
files to avoid cluttering a single one with too much info.
