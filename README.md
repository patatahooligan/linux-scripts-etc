# linux-scripts-etc

This is just a repository of some scripts and configuration files I expect to reuse across linux installations. I will slowly build it up every time I install a new system.

Nothing here is intended to be useful to other people, but if you like anything, feel free to download for personal use. Note that these files are primarily used on Arch linux. Even if you use the same software, your distro might package different, potentionally incompatible, versions.
